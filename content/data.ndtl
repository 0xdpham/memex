SIBYLLINE BOOKS
  PERS : neauoire
  SRCE : Merveilles
  QUOTE 
    > A long time ago there was a small, but prosperous town in the middle of a great plain. The town saw plenty of foreigners passing through with exotic wears, stopping on their way from the great cities that surely lay far beyond the horizon. As a prominent way-point, the town found itself never in want, not only of the necessities of life, but of many of the luxuries as well. So one can easily imagine their reaction to the unsightly old hag who strode into the town on a bright autumn afternoon carrying a sack full of a dozen dusty books.
    & "All the knowledge and wisdom of the world," She said, "Only one sack of gold!" The men and women at the marketplace chuckled at the old woman. A whole sack of gold for twelve dusty books? It didn't matter what was in them, that was an outrageous price! Their own books usually sold for a gold piece each, at best, and that only for the highest quality binding and printing. A trading village was no place to sell books, besides, considering how busy everyone is with commerce all the time; most books were bought for show.
    & The woman tried to peddle her goods all day, but found it impossible to attract the attention of even the most credulous buyer. "Leave me alone," one would say. "I have plenty of books already," said another. "Obviously you don't know everything, or you would have left already" the more snarky in the town would opine.
    & Finally, as the sun was setting, the woman approached one of the other vendors and bought a bit of firewood. She dug a small pit, placed six of the books in, along with the wood, and started a fire right in the middle of the marketplace. This attracted the Mayor, who scrammed the woman out of the village, but not before the books had burned to ashes.
    & Winter came, and the town was hit hard by blizzards lasting well into March. They were a frugal lot, however, and always planned for such a contingency, and so they braved the winter well. Summer brought the normal volume of trade, and the town was back to normal by the next autumn, when the old woman returned again.
    & "Not you again," the Mayor said as she entered the town. "Are you still selling the same nonsense?"
    & "If by 'nonsense' you mean all the knowledge and wisdom of the world," she replied, "No. I now only have half of it remaining. I have changed the price, however." At this the townspeople nodded at each other sarcastically. Of course she's changed the price, they thought, because she only has six dusty old books left. "The remaining books are only two sacks of gold!" The woman sat down among the merchants and laid the books out in front of her, waiting for any takers.
    & "You must be joking," A man said, "You can't charge twice as much for half the merchandise! We are a trading town, well-versed in business and exchange. You can't expect us to buy books of such low quality for a price so high!" The woman merely sat there, and when the day ended without any takers - but with considerably more jeering than in the previous year - she repeated her ritual and burned half the books. The morning after the woman left, a few young people from the town ruffled through the dying embers of the fire, searching for an odd page, but all was ashes once again.
    & Another year passed, and this was a hard one. Again the winter was long, and harvests around the countryside were poor. The summer trading caravans were less frequent than they had been in decades. In the end, the city managed, as it always had, but there were whispers that another hard winter would spell serious trouble.
    & When the old woman arrived in autumn, she was expected. The Mayor greeted her personally, "Madame, we would like to look at your books. We will not be able to offer you two sacks of gold right away, but we are ready to form a committee to investigate the worth, and, in a few weeks, we will be able to make a suitable offer."
    & The old woman looked back at him. "These three remaining books contain a quarter of all the knowledge and wisdom in the world, and I cannot part with them for anything less than four sacks of gold."
    & "Four sacks of gold is out of the question, madame, but if you would consider our offer..."
    & The old woman simply shook her head, and proceeded to burn two of the three remaining books, leaving the town to fend for itself for another winter.
    & When she returned again the following year the town was desperate. Trade had all but ceased, and the granaries were less than half full. The winter was just around the corner, and already it was cold and windy, though the summer had only just ended. The whole town anxiously awaited the old woman, ready to swallow their pride and purchase her remaining book.
    & The woman entered the town cautiously, holding the book in front of her. "Are you now ready to buy my book. It contains one-twelfth of the knowledge and wisdom of the world, and it is exceedingly valuable. I can only part with it for twelve sacks of gold."
    & The Mayor looked back, "We had only budgeted for six." The woman started digging her fire-pit. "Now hold on," the Mayor said, "We can give you ten, but we need something to get us through next summer's trading season." The woman kept digging. As she placed the book into the pit, along with a little kindling, the Mayor finally gave in. "You win," he said, "We'll give you twelve. It better be worth it."
    & "It is," the woman replied. "You should have seen the rest of it."

    > Turbo: compressor forcing additional air into an engine to allow for increased fuel ignition and thus increased power output. A turbo has two halves, one is driven by the exhaust from the engine the other forces air into the engine. Negative 'turbo lag' time until the engine can provide enough exhaust to spin up the turbo compressor. 
    > Supercharger: Like a turbo but instead of being driven by exhaust gas it is driven mechanically (belt to engine). Negative  Takes power/efficiency away from driving engine output in order to drive the compressor.
    > Electic supercharger: fully electronically driven turbo (generally powered by a higher voltage (48v) seperate from car 12v). Negative  high electricity use.
    > Electic turbo: a hybrid electric-assisted turbo (generally powered by a higher voltage (48v) seperate from car 12v) using a DC motor to start the turbo spinning sooner to remove turbo lag or at low revs when not enough exhaust to produced. Once the engine is providing enough exhaust to spin the turbo the motor will stop output. It can also be a seperate electric supercharger working in conjunction with a standard turbo. Negative complexity.

REGENERATIVE ECONOMIC THEORY
  DATE : 12018-10-05
  TERM 
    > Regenerative economic theory: "an economic system that works to regenerate capital assets. A capital asset is an asset that provides goods and/or services that are required for, or contribute to, our well being. In standard economic theory, one can either âregenerateâ one's capital assets or consume them until the point where the asset cannot produce a viable stream of goods and/or services. What sets regenerative economics apart from standard economic theory is that it takes into account and gives hard economic value to the principal or original capital assets â the earth and the sun. We cannot do much to affect the sun although we can value access to the sun in such areas where access can be influenced. Therefore, most of Regenerative Economics focuses on the earth and the goods and services it supplies.
    & Regenerative economics is completely comfortable within the capitalist economic framework. Recognizing the earth as the original capital asset places the true value on the human support system known as the environment. Not having this original value properly recognized has created the unsustainable economic condition referred to as uneconomic growth, a phrase coined by leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, as stated in the book Reshaping the Built Environment.[1] The authors of the regenerative economic theory believe that uneconomic growth is the opposite of regenerative economics."

PV WIRING
  LINK : https://www.solargroup.co.nz/UserFiles/File/Solar%20PV/Technical/PV%20Introduction%20guide%20for%20electricians.pdf
  NOTE
    > Voltage losses along the DC cables shall be less than 4% 
    > All DC cables should be installed to provide as short a run as possible
    > Positive and negative cables of the same string or main DC supply should be bundled together, avoiding the creation of loops in the system.
    > ["Pairs should be together in the same raceway/conduit/bundled together."](https://forum.solar-electric.com/discussion/22145/bundling-dc-cabling-together-through-plastic-electrical-conduit)
    - I assume 'pairs' mean pairs of positive and negative.
    > ["cables that are bundled together generate a cumulative amount of heat, and have more difficulty dissipating that heat than when they are run individually. This is something to be aware of, but the relevant ABYC standard only applies to wiring carrying 50 volts or more, so it is typically a problem with AC circuits on a boat, not your typical 12 volt DC wiring installation. In general, if three conductors are bundled, reduce maximum amperage by 30%. If four to six conductors are bundled, reduce maximum amperage by 40%. If seven to 24 conductors are bundled, reduce amperage by 50%."](https://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Marine-Wire-Terminal-Tech-Specs)



BLOCKCHAIN EXPLAIN
  DATE : 12018-11-06
  LINK : https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/5540/what-does-the-term-longest-chain-mean
  TAGS : bitcoin, blockchain
  TERM 
    > Blockchain: a distributed (p2p) ledger ("chain") of blocks of transactions with a dynamic-difficulty-adjusted brute-force key (next block ID) discovery system (used by the system's "accountants" called "miners").
    > Block Tree: "consists of all valid blocks whose entire ancestry is known, up to the genesis block. The rules for validness include no double spending, valid signatures, no introduction of more currency than allowed, ... These are the network rules, and every full Bitcoin node verifies them."
    > Active Chain: "is one path from genesis block at the top to some leaf node at the bottom of the block tree. Every such path is a valid choice, but nodes are expected to pick the one with the most "work" in it they know about (where work is loosely defined as the sum of the difficulties). Relativity and technological constraints prevent us from doing instant communication across the globe, so two nodes can not be expected to pick the same chain as the active one. This is no problem: the mining mechanism makes sure that the chance two nodes disagree about blocks in the past decreases exponentially as they are older."
  NOTE 
    > "Imagine that the blockchain is 210000 blocks long and TWO miners both find valid blocks within a few seconds of each other and broadcast them to the network.
    - This is perfectly normal as the Bitcoin network is peer to peer and global.
    - You now have two chains, each of length 210001. Neither of these are longer than each other. Some bitcoind nodes will see the first miner's block and some bitcoind nodes will see the second.
    - Temporarily you have two forks of the blockchain, each of length 210001 blocks long. They are identical for 210000 blocks, but the 210001st is different on the two forks.
    - Sometime later another miner finds another valid block, the 210002nd block, and that will be attached to exactly one of the forks.
    - This chain is now the longest at 210002 blocks and becomes the longest chain. It becomes the "definitive" blockchain.
    - (The transactions in the alternate fork don't disappear - they simply get put back into the pool of unconfirmed transactions and miners will put them into a subsequent block)."
